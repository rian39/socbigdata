# Genomics as big data: tensions between social intelligence and an ethic of care

In making sense of genomics as big data, much depends on what notion of social intelligence (SI) and what notion of ethic of care (EC) we turn to. Both SI and EC have been conceptualised in quite different ways. Yet there is no ready-made  social intelligence or  ethic of care that we can bring to bear on genomics. Both terms need some re-conceptualisation to accommodate non-human things and infrastructures. What counts as social intelligence and what counts as care may change in and around big data knowledge practices such as genomics.  More importantly perhaps, we cannot assume that social intelligence  and ethic of care as practices and virtues work together. They may in certain respects  be in tension with each other. It may be that the interests of social intelligence  and an ethic of care cannot be aligned and this difficulty would need to be negotiated politically and ethically. As we will suggest, the genomics collaboratory forms a process in which these negotiations can begin to take place.  

# Social intelligence in genomics

Social intelligence can refer to an individual capacity to maintain and develop relations with others. In certain accounts, this capacity is linked to the evolution of the human brain in social group settings. The SQ (Social Quotient) measures social intelligence  alongside IQ, and standard diagnostic instruments for autiism and Aspergers rely on the concept of social intelligence [@Kihlstrom_2011]. Social intelligence can also mean something like collective intelligence. Social intelligence in this sense refers to the collective effect of many people negotiating the same difficulty. This sense appears in more recent work on social media. The social physicist Sandy Pentland uses social intelligence,  for instance, in this sense [@Pentland_2014]. It is more like 'wisdom of the crowd'. Both senses of the term are difficult to apply to big data and genomics. Can we modify their usages both to account for the infrastructural and computational processes associated with big data? Do they help us grasp a deep re-structuring of experience by data and at the same time the social composition of data?  


A similar bifurcation appears in ethic of care. The classic social-psychological account by Carol Gilligan [@Gilligan_1990]  relates to gender differences in interpersonal relations (particularly in settings such as health and family). More recent versions, however, diverge in many ways. Some such as Maria Puig de la Bellacasa [@PuigdelaBellacasa_2009], focus much more on human and non-human relationships. Foucaultian accounts of ethics of care of self tend to address, by contrast, the constitution of particular historical subjects in relation to knowledge, truth and ethical practices. Like social intelligence, ethic of care refers to a range of different objects, and this can make it hard, at least in the context of genomics, to decide what cares for what. 

## Forms of social intelligence in genomics?    

In many respects, the field of genomics is an advanced form of social intelligence in both principal senses of the term. Whether we turn to the genomic sequencing projects, with their often vast, hyper-complex organisational arrangements and collaborations between researchers and institutions, or to attempts to understand rare diseases in terms of variations in DNA sequences, social intelligence appears in many forms.

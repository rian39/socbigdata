Socialising Big Data article strategy
=====================================

28 Oct 2015

1.  Start with the social framework’s (SF) two main themes - social
    intelligence and ethic of care - and exemplify and specify what
    these mean for the three domains by drawing on the immense data we
    have in the supplementary index to the working paper.  We all agreed
    that we have not yet fully drawn on that data and that the two main
    themes are good organising and analytic concepts. They will indeed
    help us organise our review of that data.

2.  By doing this we would be not just describing what is going on in
    the three domains but showing how the SF came out of the
    collaboratories, the different implications for each for each domain
    (e.g., ethics) and how this work might stimulate future work.

3.  The paper would start with an introduction discussing our
    collaboratories, the domains and how we got to the SF. The structure
    of the rest of the paper would be discussed at a next meeting and
    based on first draft analyses for each domain in relation to social
    intelligence and ethic of care. Target of about 2000-2500 words.
    This work would be led by Adrian, Penny, Evelyn. Based on this work
    we could for example decide to write up each domain in a separate
    part or integrate them according to social intelligence and ethic of
    care. Or possibly something else!

4.  In doing so we keep the following in mind:

    a.  The possibility of extending this into a short 30,000-40,000
        word monograph for the CRESC Routledge series

    b.  The journal to which the article would be submitted.

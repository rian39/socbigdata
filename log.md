- strange that we don't have any uses of the term social intelligence in the wp or the supplements. Did I miss something?
- looked up quite a few references on social intelligence and big data -- including stuff from sciencewise -- report I couldn't get but used in Cabinet; 
    - put some references for social intelligence in zotero
- care -- bellacasa -- matters of care include things; the question is how? what things matter in big data
    - care (cf Couldry) might be in conflict with accuracy or even truth
    - care as concern for the common fabric that sustains us;
    - care as trying to find the best way of living amidst the transformations that big data

- ideas -- social intelligence: matters of truth are particularly important? e.g. error, accuracy and uncertainty in genomics; what would care mean here?
- put quite a lot time trying to tame the supplements as text. Cleaned it using search-replace eventually
- discussion in supp of errors, of infrastructures and trust -- all highlight the conflicts between truth and care

- strange that we don't have any uses of the term social intelligence in the wp or the supplements. Did I miss something?
- looked up quite a few references on social intelligence and big data -- including stuff from sciencewise -- report I couldn't get but used in Cabinet; 
    - put some references for social intelligence in zotero
- care -- bellacasa -- matters of care include things; the question is how? what things matter in big data
    - care (cf Couldry) might be in conflict with accuracy or even truth
    - care as concern for the common fabric that sustains us;
    - care as trying to find the best way of living amidst the transformations that big data

- ideas -- social intelligence: matters of truth are particularly important? e.g. error, accuracy and uncertainty in genomics; what would care mean here?
- put quite a lot time trying to tame the supplements as text. Cleaned it using search-replace eventually
- discussion in supp of errors, of infrastructures and trust -- all highlight the conflicts between truth and care

- did woS science on social intelligence -- found around 900 refs, mainly to autism, primates, leadership, IQ, happiness, managerail behaviour, publication report show big increase each year, but not in 2015; th some work on intercultural communication and on farming and on virtue. Can't see if this going to be useful. 
- went through notes in supplementary appendix

- going through Ruth's 4k of notes
- looked up social intelligence again -- idea that human brain growth is linked to social intelligence could be worth thinking about; also social intelligence is sometimes equated with collective intelligence, and sometimes with individual capacities (as in Aspergers')
- we need to have a preliminary discussion about social intelligence and ethic of care. 
- wrote some stuff about various meanings of both social intelligence  and ethic of care, and how they are in tension. 
- put some new refs in zotero, but can't see where they ones are  from work computer ... 


# TODO

- check zotero sync for socbigdata
